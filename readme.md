### AwesomeCut
**Description:**
AwesomeCut is a clipboard manager. I intend to keep it as simple as possible. It's based on Flycut.

Every time you copy a code piece, AwesomeCut stores it in its history. Later, you can paste it using Shift-Command-V even if you have something different in your current clipboard. You can change the hotkey and other settings in preferences.
